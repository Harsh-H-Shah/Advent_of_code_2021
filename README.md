## What is Advent of code?

### Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

### You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.
